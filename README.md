Thanks for downloading my SH3 Camera Mod!

Okay, I'll literally just copy-paste the SH4 readme and change the relevant points.

**Changelog v1.0:**
- OTS Camera Mod
- First Person Camera Mod

Thanks to Lin Min for the Dll Wrapper that I used.

**Instructions:**
Drag and drop all the files from the .rar into your SH3 root folder. Replace if prompted. This is also compatible with Steam006's fix (and it's HIGHLY recommended to play this way). To open the mod menu, pause the game with ESC and then press F1. This only works when your game is paused (it's the opposite to the SH4 mod). Any errors, crashes or softlocks you find, let me know. Also, I've added F2 as the hotkey to switch the camera mod ON/OFF while you're in game. Use it if you don't wanna go into the mod menu.

**Remember to enable 2D controls!**

It is also recommended to set your audio setting to mono, as stereo works weirdly with the mod. If you're playing in first person, it is also recommended to turn realtime shadows off. I believe it should work during the entire game, but the flashlight shows an annoying flare when you're in first person so you'll have to deal with that until I figure out how to turn it off haha.

I also recommend to disable this mod with F2 in the mansion when you have to run from the red fog. It's clearly not supposed to be played in first or third person, so you'll have an easier time if you disable it. I'll probably add a setting to disable it automatically in a later update.

**Mod menu controls**
- F1 to enable/disable
- ESC to go back
- Enter to turn a setting ON/OFF
- WASD to navigate

Also some of you have told me you wanna tip me so I won't say no, here's my paypal crap if you wanna do it (it's not necessary, this mod is free, only do this if you wanna waste money): [Paypal crap in case you wanna waste money](https://www.paypal.me/zealottomato)
